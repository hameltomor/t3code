## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Codex-first approach -- hardest provider first validates architecture before adding others
- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure with Gemini deferred -- format too unstable to build against now
- [Roadmap]: Schema and migrations land in Phase 1 before any server or UI work
- [01-01]: Used withDecodingDefault(() => null) on providerThreadId for backward-compatible schema evolution
- [01-01]: providerThreadId hardcoded to null in ProjectionSnapshotQuery until DB migration is added

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 research flag: Codex `state_5.sqlite` schema columns and compaction event type names need validation against real installation or open-source repo
- Phase 4 research flag: Claude Code JSONL field names need confirmation against real session files
